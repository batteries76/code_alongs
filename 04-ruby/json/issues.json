For example, for afternoon the clock will be rolled forward 12 to 17 hours from midnight. However, when DST starts this will result in a time of 13:xx to 18:xx, because of the extra hour added by DST. The opposite effect happens when DST ends. On these days the random_time parameter thus has a chance to generate an off-by-one hour time. This bug seems too small to fix compared to the complexity of the fix. However, for 15 days before the end or start of DST (or 30 days per year), the test as currently written, will flake. This change eliminates the flake by fixing the dates used for the test as non-DST dates."

There's a few formats, but in the USA we use ABA-RTN codes, international stuff is SWIFT-BIC and in Europe they have IBAN.  It'd also be fun to generate a bank name.\r\n\r\nI would build this myself but frankly I have no idea how to make a random number which conforms to a checksum, and don't have any clue if these systems reserve \"example\" spaces for these purposes.  With a little handholding, I'm sure I could get it done.\r\n\r\nAt least the ABA-RTN part is easy (it's a series of checksummed numbers), SWIFT-BIC too (it's just string combining).  IBAN is a terrifying trainwreck of a format, though, just as complex as international phone numbers.  We'd probably just need a list of valid example codes.\r\n\r\nI guess the API would be something like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nFaker::BankAccount.routing_number\r\n# => '1291131673'\r\nFaker::BankAccount.routing_number(true) # true to use the rare \"fraction\" notation\r\n# => '11-3167/1210'\r\nFaker::BankAccount.account_number\r\n# => '0114584906'\r\nFaker::BankAccount.iban\r\n# => 'GR16 0110 1250 0000 0001 2300 695'\r\nFaker::BankAccount.swift\r\n# => 'DEUTDFF'\r\nFaker::BankAccount.institution_name\r\n# => 'Ontario Agriculture Bank'\r\n# => 'First Bank of Osaka'\r\n# => 'Commerce Bank of Stockholm'\r\n# => 'Great American Sperm Bank'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: after further research, it appears the check digits are rarely used on checks (leave it to banking to ignore important things) so we might just leave them off?"
